A \hyperlink{class_scheduler}{Scheduler} schedules iterative commands to be run, and then executes them in order. Commands can be added, and removed, can be scheduled to run in parallel with other commands, and can be scheduled to run persistently. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}

Scheduler.\+add\+Persistent Adds a command that is persistent, and will always run. Adds the item to an array, and the array is always iterated through and each run method is called. e.\+g. a heartbeat command e.\+g. a Status Light for bluetooth, system state, etc.

Scheduler.\+add make a new struct, and make the last element point to this Scheduler.\+add\+Parallel call add, and set the parallel member variable to true Scheduler.\+add\+Synchronized\textbackslash{} call add, and set the parallel member variable to false Scheduler.\+remove

Scheduler.\+run call the first command in the list and call the run method if the first command has parallel set to true, call the next command as well, etc. or add both to a dynamically allocated array, and end when all elements have finished=true

While iterating through parallel commands, if the command is finished, remove it from the array. Execution will not contiue until the last command is removed. Not true. If the synchronized command is removed, the parallel command will still run while the next command is run

when the command returns finished = true remove the current command Constructor
